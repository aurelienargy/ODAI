Optical System Design Optimization introduces a groundbreaking approach for the systematic design of complex optical systems, like wide-angle eyepieces. This project transcends traditional optimization limits by leveraging the innovative saddle point construction method for a broader and more comprehensive exploration of the design space.

## Project Overview

This framework presents a unique optimization methodology for developing high-performance optical systems. By integrating advanced optimization strategies with conventional tools like CodeV, it pioneers a novel method for uncovering innovative optical solutions.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Design Framework**: Employs a saddle point construction method to generate numerous starting points, facilitating a wider exploration of the design space.
- **GUI-Driven Workflow**: Enhances accessibility and usability through a user-friendly graphical interface that manages the optical system design process.
- **CodeV Integration**: Seamlessly interfaces with CodeV for leveraging powerful local and global optimization capabilities.
- **Python-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes Python for added flexibility in data manipulation and analysis, including tree creation and merit function evaluation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to incorporate this framework into your optical design projects:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   Ensure both Python and CodeV are installed on your system. This project requires functional installations of both.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Download the project to your machine by cloning the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pierregab/ODAI.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install any required Python libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the Application**:
   Execute the main application script to initiate the optimization process. The GUI will guide you through configuring your optical system for optimization.
